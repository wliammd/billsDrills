# Drills: Part of Every Healthy Intellectual Diet {#intro}

The goal of this book is to organize my R drills into reasonable chunks, the better to understand my strengths and weaknesses, and to plan new forays into data science.

Notes on **bookdown**: 

  * the `_bookdown.yml` file contains a snippet that is important to inserting the word "Chapter" before the chapter number in each of the Rmd files. 
  * packages are indicated in bold, like **dplyr**
  * inline code and filenames are indicated in typerwriter face, like `_bookdown.yml`
  * `_output.yml` is modified from that used by Xie in his `bookdown-demo` [@R-bookdown]; it evokes `style.css`, `toc.css`, `preamble.tex`, which are also borrowed from Xie.
