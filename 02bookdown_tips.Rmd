# **bookdown** Tips for This Document {#bookdownplan}

## Basic conventions 
  * I am deeply indepted to Yihui Xie and his tireless efforts to improve open source publishing via **bookdown**. The basic structure of this book is taken directly from Xie's `bookdown-demo` [@R-bookdown]. 
  * The `_bookdown.yml` file contains a snippet that is important to inserting the word "Chapter" before the chapter number in each of the Rmd files. 
  * `_output.yml` is modified from that used by Xie in his `bookdown-demo` [@R-bookdown]; it evokes `style.css`, `toc.css`, `preamble.tex`, which are also borrowed from Xie. 
  * Packages are indicated in bold, like **dplyr**
  * Programs, like RStudio or MS Word, are in regular typeface
  * Inline code, functions, and file names are indicated in typewriter face using backticks, like `_bookdown.yml`. Functions are generally written with parentheses, like `mean()`. 
  * Chapters are set in order by using adding 01, 02, 03, ... before the name of their Rmd, like `01chpter.Rmd`. Note that they can have short descriptive phrases, since the actual chapter titles are determined by the hashtag. `index.Rmd` always comes first in the book build, and contains the `yml` front matter. 
  * The most frequently used keyboard shortcuts from RStudio include:
    + Option-Hyphen (the assignment operator)
    + Shift-Control-c (comment code hashtag)
    + Option-Command-i (code chunk)
    + Shift-Control-m (pipe)
  
When building PDF's with bookdown, the following will prevent source code from running off the page:

```{r}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60),tidy=TRUE)
```

## Inserting pictures

Pictures can be included in the `pathologyImages` subdirectory and referenced with a descriptive title in brackets followed by the file path in parentheses, like this: ``![Pithy title. Figure A. Figure B](filepath/image_name.jpg)``

Note that I had to use double backticks around the above code in order to display the "Pithy title" figure reference. 

Here's an example with a real image (code hidden in the final document):

![Tpit immunohistochemical stain. Figure A silent corticotroph. Figure B gonadotroph](pathologyImages/TpitIHC.jpg)

Some of the subdirectories throw an error in building the book, so I settled on `_bookdown_files/pathologyImages` as the location.

Also, note that the build does not generate the caption unless the reference is on it's own line. 

Also note that some controls on image size are available. For instance, the same image can be displayed at 50% size using {} after the reference, as follows:

``![Tpit immunohistochemical stain. Figure A silent corticotroph. Figure B gonadotroph](pathologyImages/TpitIHC.jpg){#id.class width=50% height=50%}``

![Tpit immunohistochemical stain. Figure A silent corticotroph. Figure B gonadotroph](pathologyImages/TpitIHC.jpg){#id.class width=50% height=50%}

## Referencing other parts of the document

Say that I want to refer the reader to a figure. I accomplish this with by inserting a reference with a snippet like this: ``\@ref(fig:example_figure-1)``

Now for a real reference. See Figure \@ref(fig:starfig-1).

I can reference other pages in a similar fashion, for instance, ``\@ref(bookdownplan)``. Note that this works by referencing a `{#label}` placed in the chapter title. 

See Chapter \@ref(intro)
See Chapter \@ref(bookdownplan). 

Note that the `{#label}` uses a single run-together word. It does not tolerate spaces and this cannot be overcome by 'quoting' it. 

## Referencing citations:

In order to insert citations, one needs a .bib file in the project. I've included one in this project as `book.bib`. The yml header in Chapter \@ref(intro) needs to have a $bibliography:$ and $biblio-style:$ line added. 

To insert a citation, use the **citr** Addin from RStudio. **bookdown**, for instance, is cited thusly ``[@R-bookdown]`` [@R-bookdown]. I enjoy the convenience of EndNote in MS Word, so I populate the `book.bib` and packages.bib files carefully, with .txt files generated in EndNote.

For instance, a recent dump of my EndNote library is in `bookFromEndnote.txt`. This can be opened in RStudio, and I can copy-and-paste references from the .txt file to my book.bib. For instance, if I have a breast pathology paper that I want to cite here [@RN2750], I'd copy-and-paste the reference from `bookFromEndnote.txt` to `book.bib`. Generally speaking, I maintain all references in EndNote, and manually generate a .txt file to update my references. 

Of note, Yihui Xie includes a nifty bit of code to automatically generate a bib database for all the R packages that I'd like to cite:

```{r}
knitr::write_bib(c(.packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'tidyverse', 'caret'), 'packages.bib')
```

All packages are maintained in `packages.bib`. 

In the knitted document, references appear automatically at the end of ~~a chapter~~ the document.  

## Figures.   

 **tidverse** and **gglplot2** are used extensively in this book. The most powerful arguments that can be brought to these analyses are made with graphs and tables. 

```{r loadTidyverse, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Now to generate a figure. The code chunk contains the following: `{r starfig-1, fig.cap='Starwars Figure 1'}`. This labels the figure with a short name, *starfig-1*, and gives it the caption *Starwars Figure 1*. 

```{r starfig-1, fig.cap='Starwars Figure 1'}
starwars %>% filter(!is.na(species)) %>% 
  mutate(species = fct_lump(species, 5)) %>% 
  mutate(species = species %>% fct_infreq() %>% fct_rev()) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(species, fill = gender)) +
  labs(
    title = "Nifty Starwars Figure",
    x = "Species",
    y = "Count"
  ) +
  coord_flip()
```
