# Factor Practice {#factorpractice}

## The basic structure

Let's say that you have 100 cups of sizes small, medium, or large. 

```{r}
cups <- c("small", "medium", "large")
set.seed(2020)
manyCups <- sample(cups, size = 100, replace = TRUE)
table(manyCups)
```

Note that `table()` renders these in alphabetical order. It's usually more useful to render them in order of magnitude by setting levels. 

```{r}
sizesCups <- factor(manyCups, levels = c("small", "medium", "large"))
sizesCups
table(sizesCups)
```

The **forcats** package is designed to work with factors.
