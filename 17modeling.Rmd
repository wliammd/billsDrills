## Modeling notes

Notes on/inspired by the Machine Learning with caret in R DataCamp course. 

### An **rpart** classification example.

```{r}
model <- rpart(
  Species ~ .,
  data = iris,
  method = "class"
)

predicted <- predict(model, iris, type = "class")
predicted
mean(predicted == iris$Species)
```

Study what's going on in **predict()**:

```{r}
?predict.rpart
```
