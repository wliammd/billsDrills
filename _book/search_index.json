The basic structure of this book is taken directly from Xie’s bookdown-demo (Xie 2021). The _bookdown.yml file contains a snippet that is important to inserting the word “Chapter” before the chapter number in each of the Rmd files. _output.yml is modified from that used by Xie in his bookdown-demo (Xie 2021); it evokes style.css, toc.css, preamble.tex, which are also borrowed from Xie. Packages are indicated in bold, like dplyr Programs, like RStudio or MS Word, are in regular typeface Inline code, functions, and file names are indicated in typewriter face using backticks, like _bookdown.yml. Functions are generally written with parentheses, like mean(). Chapters are set in order by using adding 01, 02, 03, … before the name of their Rmd, like 01chpter.Rmd. Note that they can have short descriptive phrases, since the actual chapter titles are determined by the hashtag. index.Rmd always comes first in the book build, and contains the yml front matter. The most frequently used keyboard shortcuts from RStudio include: Option-Hyphen (the assignment operator) Shift-Control-c (comment code hashtag) Option-Command-i (code chunk) Shift-Control-m (pipe) When building PDF’s with bookdown, the following will prevent source code from running off the page: library(knitr) opts_chunk$set(tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60),tidy=TRUE) 2.2 Inserting pictures Pictures can be included in the pathologyImages subdirectory and referenced with a descriptive title in brackets followed by the file path in parentheses, like this: ![Pithy title. Figure A. Figure B](filepath/image_name.jpg) Note that I had to use double backticks around the above code in order to display the “Pithy title” figure reference. Here’s an example with a real image (code hidden in the final document): Tpit immunohistochemical stain. Figure A silent corticotroph. Figure B gonadotroph Some of the subdirectories throw an error in building the book, so I settled on _bookdown_files/pathologyImages as the location. Also, note that the build does not generate the caption unless the reference is on it’s own line. Also note that some controls on image size are available. For instance, the same image can be displayed at 50% size using {} after the reference, as follows: ![Tpit immunohistochemical stain. Figure A silent corticotroph. Figure B gonadotroph](pathologyImages/TpitIHC.jpg){#id.class width=50% height=50%} Tpit immunohistochemical stain. Figure A silent corticotroph. Figure B gonadotroph 2.3 Referencing other parts of the document Say that I want to refer the reader to a figure. I accomplish this with by inserting a reference with a snippet like this: \\@ref(fig:example_figure-1) Now for a real reference. See Figure 2.1. I can reference other pages in a similar fashion, for instance, \\@ref(bookdownplan). Note that this works by referencing a {#label} placed in the chapter title. See Chapter 1 See Chapter 2. Note that the {#label} uses a single run-together word. It does not tolerate spaces and this cannot be overcome by ‘quoting’ it. 2.4 Referencing citations: In order to insert citations, one needs a .bib file in the project. I’ve included one in this project as book.bib. The yml header in Chapter 1 needs to have a \\(bibliography:\\) and \\(biblio-style:\\) line added. To insert a citation, use the citr Addin from RStudio. bookdown, for instance, is cited thusly [@R-bookdown] (Xie 2021). I enjoy the convenience of EndNote in MS Word, so I populate the book.bib and packages.bib files carefully, with .txt files generated in EndNote. For instance, a recent dump of my EndNote library is in bookFromEndnote.txt. This can be opened in RStudio, and I can copy-and-paste references from the .txt file to my book.bib. For instance, if I have a breast pathology paper that I want to cite here (Stevens and Parekh 2016), I’d copy-and-paste the reference from bookFromEndnote.txt to book.bib. Generally speaking, I maintain all references in EndNote, and manually generate a .txt file to update my references. Of note, Yihui Xie includes a nifty bit of code to automatically generate a bib database for all the R packages that I’d like to cite: knitr::write_bib(c(.packages(), &#39;bookdown&#39;, &#39;knitr&#39;, &#39;rmarkdown&#39;, &#39;tidyverse&#39;, &#39;caret&#39;), &#39;packages.bib&#39;) All packages are maintained in packages.bib. In the knitted document, references appear automatically at the end of a chapter the document. 2.5 Figures. tidverse and gglplot2 are used extensively in this book. The most powerful arguments that can be brought to these analyses are made with graphs and tables. library(tidyverse) Now to generate a figure. The code chunk contains the following: {r starfig-1, fig.cap='Starwars Figure 1'}. This labels the figure with a short name, starfig-1, and gives it the caption Starwars Figure 1. starwars %&gt;% filter(!is.na(species)) %&gt;% mutate(species = fct_lump(species, 5)) %&gt;% mutate(species = species %&gt;% fct_infreq() %&gt;% fct_rev()) %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(species, fill = gender)) + labs( title = &quot;Nifty Starwars Figure&quot;, x = &quot;Species&quot;, y = &quot;Count&quot; ) + coord_flip() Figure 2.1: Starwars Figure 1 2.6 Working with Github Document control is important. Using the terminal, one can maintain a Github repository for a project. Recent changes at require the use of a personal access token rather than a password in order to update the repo from the terminal.
