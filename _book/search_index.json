Note that they can have short descriptive phrases, since the actual chapter titles are determined by the hashtag. index.Rmd always comes first in the book build, and contains the yml front matter. the most frequently used keyboard shortcuts from RStudio include: Option-Hyphen (the assignment operator) Shift-Control-c (comment code hashtag) Option-Command-i (code chunk) Shift-Control-m (pipe) 2.2 Referencing other parts of the document This is a good place to practice referencing figures. Say that I want to refer the reader back to my first starwars figure. See Figure ??. I can reference other pages in a similar fashion. See Chapter 10. Note that this works by referencing a {#label} placed in the chapter title. See Chapter 1 See Chapter 3 Note that the {#label} uses a single run-together word. It does not tolerate spaces and this cannot be overcome by ‘quoting’ it. 2.3 Inserting pictures Pictures can be included in the test-book_files subdirectories and referenced like this: Tpit immunohistochemical stain. Figure A silent corticotroph. Figure B gonadotroph Some of the subdirectories throw an error in building the book, so I settled on _bookdown_files/pathologyImages as the location. Also, I note that the build does not generate the caption unless the reference is on it’s own line. Also note that some controls on image size are available. For instance, the same image can be displayed at 50% size: Tpit immunohistochemical stain. Figure A silent corticotroph. Figure B gonadotroph 2.4 Referencing citations: In order to insert citations, one needs a .bib file in the project. I’ve included one in this project as book.bib. The yml header in Chapter 1 needs to have a \\(bibliography:\\) and \\(biblio-style:\\) line added. To insert a citation, use the citr Addin from RStudio. bookdown, for instance, is cited thusly (Xie 2020). Note that I need to figure out an adequate workflow of references. The convenience of Endnote in MS Word will not be available. Nonetheless, if I populate the book.bib and packages.bib files carefully, with .txt files generated in Endnote, I should be OK. For instance, a recent dump of my Endnote library is in bookFromEndnote.txt. This can be opened in RStudio, and I can copy-and-paste references from the .txt file to my book.bib. For instance, if I have a breast paper that I want to cite here (Stevens and Parekh 2016), I’d copy-and-paste the reference from bookFromEndnote.txt to book.bib. Of note, Yihui Xie includes a nifty bit of code to automatically generate a bib database for R packages: knitr::write_bib(c(.packages(), &#39;bookdown&#39;, &#39;knitr&#39;, &#39;rmarkdown&#39;, &#39;tidyverse&#39;, &#39;ComplexHeatmap&#39;), &#39;packages.bib&#39;) ## Warning in knitr::write_bib(c(.packages(), &quot;bookdown&quot;, &quot;knitr&quot;, &quot;rmarkdown&quot;, : ## package(s) ComplexHeatmap not found References appear automatically at the end of a chapter.
