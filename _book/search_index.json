My goal with this page is to convey these ideas in a way that is relevant to my colleagues in pathology, radiology, neuroradiology, oncology, neurosurgery, and neuro-oncology. Why? Because systems that understand these ideas will use them to improve patient care. Systems that don’t, won’t. As a matter of fact, systems that remain in the dark will provide increasingly expensive, dysfunctional, inefficient, and ineffective care in the pursuit of what they believe (incorrectly) to be quaternary care–whatever the hell that is. Generally, I think that David Robinson’s descriptive (as opposed to prescriptive) approach to these ideas is a good one. Prescriptive approaches are exceedingly complex and fragile. See, for instance, the editorial in the August 2021 issue of Neurosurgery: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34015816/. The authors trade simplicity for breadth and appear to be motivated more by intellectual property concerns than by a desire to guide colleagues through the process of data collection, analysis, and modeling. Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund’s R for Data Science or Gareth James et al.’s An Introduction to Statistical Learning offer much more investigator-based approaches to the field, even if the majority of their book can be said to be outside of the field of AI/ML, in the case of R4DS (probably only the chapters on modeling can be said to fit into ML). I will adopt Robinson’s convention: But let’s back up and ask: what role does DS/ML play? Drew Conway’s classic description of data science is helpful http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram. The Conway venn diagram looks like this: One of the best references for learning about machine learning is Greener et al1. 20.2 Supervised versus unsuperised learning 20.3 Classification versus regression References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
